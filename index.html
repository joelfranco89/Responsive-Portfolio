				Hello! My name is Joel Franco and i have a Bachelors of Business Administration in Finance at Florida International University. I currently work at Zoes Kitchen Corporate Office in the accounts payable department. After several years of convincing from my family, i decided to give coding a try. I have been learning to code since March 2017 and could not be any happier because of my decision to start this journey. I can honestly say i truly enjoy coding. I started off learning iOS programming using Swift and created two simple apps that is available in the app store. I created a wordpress website to showcase my apps, as well as, provide mini iOS programming tutorials for anyone interested in learning. You can find the link to my page <a href="https://francstudiosinc.com">here</a>. After taking a quick break from iOS coding, i decided to take it up a notch and dive into full stack web development. I am currently a student at the SMU Coding Bootcamp course offered at SMU in Dallas, TX. I am excited to see what my future holds in the world of technology.
